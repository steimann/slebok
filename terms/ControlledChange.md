# Controlled Change
## Definition
> a change of a software artefact which is guaranteed to satisfy given conditions

For instance, a [refactoring](Refactoring.md) is a controlled change, since it is guaranteed to preserve well-formedness and behaviour. Other controlled changes may guarantee other properties. This may be of particular interest for certified software, which need not be re-certified if all changes to it are performed by a (certified) controlled change tool.
